/*
Reference books are housed in a specific collection (e.g., the Iowa Room, Burling, or Science), and reference books do not circulate.

In addition to fields and methods of library books, a reference book has

    fields
        String collection
    constructors and methods
        a constructor using 5 parameters for an author, title, ISBN number, call number, and collection
        getters and setters
        void checkout is not allowed for reference books, so the method should print that the patron "cannot check out a reference book".  (This should have been designed as an exception.)
        void returned is not allowed, and should print "reference book could not have been checked out -- return impossible". (This should have been designed as an exception.)
        String circulationStatus should return "non-circulating reference book".
        String toString from LibraryBook should be augmented with the collection information

With checkout, returned, and circulationStatus implemented for LibraryBook, this is a fully-implemented class.
